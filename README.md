# Demonstrating a simple Logisitic Regression for prediciting lung cancer using a dummy lung_dataset

The code is a Python script that performs a lung cancer classification analysis. Here is a summary of the code:

1.	The code imports the necessary libraries for the analysis, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2.	The code reads in a CSV file called "lung_dataset.csv" and assigns it to a Pandas DataFrame called "raw_df". It then displays the first few rows of the DataFrame using the "head()" method, the columns of the DataFrame using the "columns" attribute, and the summary information of the DataFrame using the "info()" and "describe()" methods.

3.	The code creates a count plot of smoking status versus lung cancer using the Seaborn "countplot()" method. It also sets the title, x-label, and y-label of the plot, and then displays the plot using the Matplotlib "show()" method.

4.	The code creates a histogram of the age distribution using the Seaborn "histplot()" method. It also sets the title, x-label, and y-label of the plot, and then displays the plot using the Matplotlib "show()" method.

5.	The code calculates the correlation matrix of the DataFrame using the Pandas "corr()" method. It then creates a heatmap of the correlation matrix using the Seaborn "heatmap()" method. Finally, it displays the heatmap using the Matplotlib "show()" method.

6.	The code performs one-hot encoding on the "GENDER" column of the DataFrame using the Pandas "get_dummies()" method. It then drops the "GENDER" column from the DataFrame and joins the one-hot encoded DataFrame with the original DataFrame. It also uses the LabelEncoder method of Scikit-Learn to convert the "LUNG_CANCER" column into numerical values. The code displays the first few rows of the resulting DataFrame, the value counts of the "LUNG_CANCER" column, and the columns of the DataFrame.

7.	The code selects a list of features to use for the classification, creates an "x" DataFrame consisting of these features, and creates a "y" Series consisting of the "LUNG_CANCER" column. It then uses the "train_test_split()" function from Scikit-Learn to split the data into training and testing sets. It also creates a dictionary containing information about the split.

8.	The code creates a logistic regression model using Scikit-Learn's "LogisticRegression()" class, fits the model to the training data after scaling the features with a standard scaler, and makes predictions on the testing data. It then calculates the accuracy score of the model using Scikit-Learn's "accuracy_score()" function.

9.	The code computes the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) score using Scikit-Learn's "roc_curve()" and "auc()" functions. It then plots the ROC curve using Matplotlib's "plot()" method and displays it using the "show()" method.
